        <h1>Hi:)</h1>
        <p class="type"> This Program is a Simple Car Game.</br>
            This is the first prototype.
            You are competing against a <strong>Machine Learning Car</strong>
            with the same speed.</br>
            This car operates by utilizing a <strong>Feed Forward</strong> algorithm
            for it's neural network.</br>
            Since it is just a simple game to release stress
            your controls are the <strong>ARROW</strong> keys
            on your computer keyboard</br>
            <strong>UP</strong> key moves car forward</br>
            <strong>DOWN</strong> key is reverse</br>
            <strong>RIGHT</strong> key is right </br>
            <strong>LEFT</strong> key is left</br>
            Your <strong>Mission</strong> is to bypass other cars without
            colliding with any car or outer road 
            borders.</br>
            This is <strong>LEVEL ONE</strong> with only 20 cars to bypass
            </br>
            The AI car is <strong><span class="blue">BLUE</span></strong>.
            Your car is <strong><span class="pink">PINK</span></strong>.</br>
            If you collide <strong>GAME OVER</strong>.
            Press on the <strong>Reload</strong>
            button to start again.
